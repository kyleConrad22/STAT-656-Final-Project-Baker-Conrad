### Questions of interest
\begin{itemize}
  \item How is the growth of plants within the Sonoran Desert affected by different fertilization methods and nitrogen atmospheric deposition.
  \item Is there a difference in the impact of these fertilization methods and nitrogen deposition between the three zones studied? These zones are: with the urban core, west of the urban core, and east of the urban core.
  \item Is there a difference apparent between affect on growth of annual plants as compared to perennial plants? What is the impact on growth of Larrea Tridentata plants specifically?
\end{itemize}

# Analysis and Data Processing
## Preprocessing the Data
Loading the required packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # For re-formatting data sets
library(lubridate) # For manipulations of date columns
```

Read in data:
```{r}
annuals_biomass <- read.csv("Data/632_annuals_biomass.csv")
annuals_composition <- read.csv("Data/632_annuals_composition.csv")
atmospheric_deposition <- read.csv("Data/632_atmospheric_deposition.csv")
fertilizer_application <- read.csv("Data/632_fertilizer_application.csv")
plant_root_simulator <- read.csv("Data/632_plant_root_simulator.csv")
stem_growth <- read.csv("Data/632_stem_growth.csv")
tissue_chn <- read.csv("Data/632_tissue_chn.csv")
tissue_icp <- read.csv("Data/632_tissue_icp.csv")
```

Prior to beginning analysis, the data should be cleaned to remove justifiable outlying observations. Additionally, variables which will not be used will be removed from each sub data set prior to combining data.\

Begin by cleaning up `annuals_biomass` which contains the response variable of interest, biomass of annuals.
```{r, results="hide"}
# Check number of missing subquad_orientation measurements
sum(is.na(annuals_biomass$subquad_orientation))

# Drop subquad_orientation from data set due to high number of missing observations
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, select = -c(subquad_orientation))

# Remove uninformative notes variable values
unique(annuals_biomass$notes)

vec <- c("average bag wt (n=10) = 6.733", "changed from 17.34 to 27.34 after rechecking", "2 bags combined for one sample", "average bag wt (n=10) = 1.437", "Some of the brown bags differed in type due to location where the bags were purchased. The two types of bag used were lunch bags and giant lunch bags. The lunch bags were smaller and the giant lunch bags were larger. Average weight of small bag (n = 10) = 7.297; average weight of large bag (n = 10) = 10.241.", "very little vegetation", "bubble in compass", "Ambrosia", "B4 on bag", "Dry plants")

annuals_biomass$notes[annuals_biomass$notes %in% vec] <- NA

# Check the notes variables and set mass to 0 when no biomass was collected, per notes variable
vec <- c("no biomass to collect", "no sample; average bag wt (n=10) = 6.733", "no biomass to collect in sample quad; average bag wt (n=10) = 1.437", "no plants to collect")

annuals_biomass$mass[annuals_biomass$notes %in% vec] <- 0
annuals_biomass$notes[annuals_biomass$notes %in% vec] <- NA

# Remaining observations have unresolved sampling errors therefore these observations are dropped.
vec <- unique(annuals_biomass$notes)
vec <- vec[!is.na(vec)]
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, !(notes %in% vec))

# Drop notes variable
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, select=-c(notes))

# Samples are collected in the spring each year and sampled once a year, therefore, date variable contains no useful information for this analysis. Drop the date variable
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, select=-c(date))

# If mass is NA for any other observations then will remove those observations. Cannot determine reasoning behind the NA's.
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, !is.na(mass))

# plot_id contains the same information as treatment_code, therefore it will be dropped
annuals_biomass <- subset(annuals_biomass, select = -c(plot_id))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rm(vec)
```


Note that for this analysis, we are only interested in the total growth of annual and perennial plants. We are not interested in composition of the plants within each plot. It can be assumed that since all plots are within the Sonoran Desert that the species growing in each plot year over year will be similar and therefore will have minimal impact on observed growth. Therefore, `annuals_composition` will be disregarded throughout this analysis. Finally, it should be noted that the plots used for composition measurements were different plots than the plots used for biomass measurements. There is little reason for these plots to effect the others' measurements.\

Nonetheless, see below the process for cleaning `annuals_composition`, should the data be used at a later date:
```{r, results="hide"}
# Begin by dropping the date variable for similar reasons as its removal from annuals_biomass
annuals_composition <- subset(annuals_composition, select=-c(date))

# Observations of cover_type == "sampled" contain no pertinent information, therefore, they will be dropped
annuals_composition <- subset(annuals_composition, cover_type != "sampled")

# Similarly, cover_category contains no useful information for this analysis and will therefore be dropped.
annuals_composition <- subset(annuals_composition, select = -c(cover_category))

# Additionally, drop the collector variable. Since this variable is not shared with biomass it cannot be used for analysis.
annuals_composition <- subset(annuals_composition, select = -c(collector))

# Now, collate the data by cover_type and set NA values to 0. That is, NA values are assumed to be observations where the plant was not observed. 
annuals_composition_collated <- annuals_composition %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = cover_type, values_from = cover_amount)

annuals_composition_collated[is.na(annuals_composition_collated)] <- 0

annuals_composition <- annuals_composition_collated

# Finally, note that the observation: site_code == "PWP", plot_id == 33, treatment_code == "C1", location_within_plot == "P", subplot == 2, and year == "2013"; has a far outlying total_shrub_cover variable value (7.000). It is assumed that this was a mistake in data collection and as such will be set as the sum of all other observed covers. 
# This task is ignored for the time being as this data will not be used for analysis.
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Remove unused variables from the environment
rm(annuals_composition_collated, annuals_composition)
```

The soil anion and cation results available in the `plant_root_simulator` dataset are not of interest in this analysis. Therefore, this dataset will be disregarded for the analysis.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Remove unused dataset from the environment
rm(plant_root_simulator)
```

Similarly, this analysis is only interested in how the application of different types of fertilizer affects plant growth and if these affects vary based on region. Since the same amount of fertilizer is applied in each region, the data contained within `fertilizer_application` is not pertinent for this analysis. It will therefore be disregarded.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Remove unused dataset from the environment
rm(fertilizer_application)
```

The data sets; `tissue_chn`, `tissue_icp`, and `stem_growth` all contain measurements that would not be useful for determining the affect of fertilizer application on plant growth. They would be response variables similar to total plant growth observed, therefore these data sets will be disregarded. 
```{r, echo =FALSE}
rm(tissue_chn, tissue_icp, stem_growth)
```


Now, to clean up the data set `atmospheric_deposition`:
```{r, results='hide'}
# Examine the notes variable values and see if there are any observations which should be removed
unique(atmospheric_deposition$notes)

# None of the observations appear to need to be removed, therefore, the notes variable can be safely dropped. 
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, select = -c(notes))

# Remove the all observations where field_id == "KCl_blank" this obesrvation is not useful for analysis.
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, field_id != "KCl_blank")

# Note that run_id is not useful for this analysis, it will therefore be removed.
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, select = -c(run_id))

# Now collate the data set such that it is in a usable format.
atmospheric_deposition <- atmospheric_deposition %>% pivot_wider(names_from = analyte_name, values_from = concentration)

# Note that there are a number of observations where either Ammonia or Nitrate/Nitrite are NA. There is enough data available that these observations can be safety dropped.
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, !is.na(Ammonia) & !is.na(`NItrate/Nitrite`))

# Remove observations which cannot be used for analysis based on field_id value.
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, !(field_id %in% c("resin.KCl.1", "resin.KCl.2", "resin.KCl.3")))
```

Continue by removing observations which are not pertinent to this analysis and convert data into the same format as the `annual_biomass` data set. Then, investigate the number of missing observations in this data set to see if it contains enough information for use in our analysis.
```{r}
# Format the date in atmospheric deposition and remove old date variable
atmospheric_deposition$year <- format(as.Date(atmospheric_deposition$collection_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%Y")

atmospheric_deposition$month <- format(as.Date(atmospheric_deposition$collection_date, format="%Y-%m-%d"), "%m")

atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, select = -c(collection_date))

# Change month variable into a more interpretable season variable
atmospheric_deposition$month <- as.numeric(atmospheric_deposition$month)

atmospheric_deposition$season <- ifelse(atmospheric_deposition$month %in% c(2, 3, 4), "Spring", 
                                        ifelse(atmospheric_deposition$month %in% c(5,6,7), "Summer",
                                               ifelse(atmospheric_deposition$month %in% c(8,9,10), "Fall", "Winter")))

# Observations for winter of a given year can be made in January of the following year.
atmospheric_deposition$year <- as.numeric(atmospheric_deposition$year)

atmospheric_deposition$year[atmospheric_deposition$month == 1] = 
  atmospheric_deposition$year[atmospheric_deposition$month == 1] - 1

atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, select = -c(month))

# Remove observations of atmospheric_deposition which contain no usable information
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, year != 2008 & !(year == 2009 & season == "Spring"))

atmospheric_deposition <- atmospheric_deposition[!grepl("CNTL", atmospheric_deposition$field_id), ]
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, !(site_code %in% c("GTW", "LVE")))
atmospheric_deposition <- atmospheric_deposition[!grepl("MONTH", atmospheric_deposition$field_id), ]

# Create a single measure of atmospheric deposition for each season at each site by taking the average of all observations for that site, season and year.
atmospheric_deposition <- subset(atmospheric_deposition, select = -c(field_id))

atmospheric_deposition <- atmospheric_deposition %>%
  group_by(site_code, year, season) %>%
  summarize(Ammonia = mean(Ammonia), `Nitrate/Nitrite` = mean(`NItrate/Nitrite`))

atmospheric_deposition <- data.frame(atmospheric_deposition)

# Amend data with all unique combinations of season, year, and site_code
atmospheric_deposition <- atmospheric_deposition %>% complete(site_code, year, season)

# Investigate the number of missing observations
print(paste("There are", sum(is.na(atmospheric_deposition$Ammonia)), "missing Ammonia measurements and", sum(is.na(atmospheric_deposition$`Nitrate.Nitrite`)), "missing Nitrate/Nitrite measurements."))
print(paste("There are a total of", nrow(atmospheric_deposition), "observations in the atmospheric deposition data set."))
```

```{r}
# Remove unused dataset from memory
rm(atmospheric_deposition)
```

As seen above more than 25\% of the observations necessary for the specified analysis are missing. Additionally, inclusion of the atmospheric deposition data would result in reducing the size of usable observations by approximately half (see below). Therefore, the decision was made to not include the data in `atmospheric_deposition` in this analysis. Should, in the future, more data be found one could have completed the analysis with this data using the following method.\

The annual biomass of plants is measured each spring (in March). Therefore, the atmospheric deposition measurements corresponding to each observation are only valid if they occurred before this date. Additionally, measurements of atmospheric deposition were taken every 3 months. Therefore, you can use the deposition data from Summer, Fall and Winter of the previous year and the Spring of the current year as explanatory variables for a given observation of mass. Finally, note that each sub-quadrant of each subplot is harvest once every 4 years. Therefore, it should actually be the previous 4 years of observations of atmospheric deposition which affect growth.\

Although it will result in the loss of some data, the above method was chosen as the optimal manner of analysis to ensure that our data is modeled correctly and inference accurate. Since the first observation of biomass was made in Spring of 2008 and the first observation of deposition was made in Fall of 2008 there will be 4.5 years of data loss from `annuals_biomass`.\

Finally, a variable must be added to group the different sites by their common geographic region. That is whether the region is west, within, or east of the city core. 
```{r}
annuals_biomass$region <- NA
annuals_biomass$region[annuals_biomass$site_code %in% c("DBG", "MVP", "PWP", "SME", "SMW")] <- "core"
annuals_biomass$region[annuals_biomass$site_code %in% c("EME", "EMW", "SNE", "SNW", "WTM")] <- "west"
annuals_biomass$region[annuals_biomass$site_code %in% c("LDP", "MCN", "MCS", "SRR", "UMP")] <- "east"
```

## Methods and Sampling Descriptions
### Fertilizer Application
Fertilization with N, P, and N+P of 20 m x 20 m plots at 4 sites each in upwind, core, and downwind positions will be done twice per year to test the hypothesis that urban N deposition pushes the desert system toward P limitation. The level of N addition (as NH4NO3) is chosen to be ~ twice the current maximum deposition rate, i.e., 60 kg kg ha-1 y-1; P addition level is 1/5 (by mass; 1/11 by atoms) that of N at 12 kg ha-1 y-1. Fertilizer is applied to treatment plots each winter and summer to coincide with the bimodal precipitation patterns characteristic of the region. The prescribed weight of dry, granular fertilizer (ammonium-nitrate for nitrogen treatments (N, N+P), triple-super phosphate for phosphorus treatments (P, N+P)) is applied using a hand spreader. As of August 2015, the rate of N fertilizer application was reduced to 30 kg ha-1 y-1, with a resulting N:P ratio of 2.5:1.

### Plant Root Simulator
Soil anion and cation availability are quantified twice annually using ion-exchange membranes. Ion-exchange membranes (Plant Root Simulator (PRS) probes) are provided and analyzed by Western Ag Innovations, Saskatchewan, Canada. Probes for the analysis of soil anions and cations are deployed in pairs at locations under the canopy of L. tridentata (n=4) and in inter-plant spaces (n=4) within selected study plots. The probes are inserted vertically into the top 15 cm of soil, and left undisturbed until extraction after approximately 6 weeks in the ground. Upon extraction, the 8 probes of each type (anion/cation) from each habitat (plant/inter-plant) are pooled, washed with distilled water in accordance with protocols outlined by Western Ag Innovations Inc., and shipped overnight to Western Ag Innovations Inc. for analysis. PRS probe analyses typically focus on nitrogen species (i.e., NO3-N and NH4-N). However, a broader suite of analytes is assessed approximately every 3-5 years.

### Stem Growth
Stem length on select L. tridentata shrubs are measured twice per year—once in the fall and again in the spring. Five L. tridentata shrubs (designated L1 thru L5) have been selected as study plants in each plot at all CN Dep sites. Measurements are taken at 4 points on each study plant—one on a stem facing each of the cardinal directions. Each time the shrubs are measured, a new piece of colored lab tape is placed around the stem, which will be used as the point from which to measure stem elongation during the following period. Field Protocol: Before arriving at the study site, cut ca. 1-inch pieces of lab tape in half length-wise and loosely stick to back of clipboard. Make enough pieces for each direction on each plant (20 per plot). Label each piece with a plant number (L1-L5) on the left side of the tape and a cardinal direction (N, S, E, W) on the right side. Study plants are marked L1 thru L5 with a silver tree tag. For each of the 5 study plants per plot: 1. Measure stem elongation: a. Look for a piece of colored tape in each cardinal direction of the shrub. Make sure the calipers are calibrated to zero and you are measuring in mm. Measure the stem (in mm) from the node directly above the piece of tape to the last node on the stem. b. If the stem branches at any point above the tape, measure each branch separately and record all the branch lengths separated by commas on the datasheet. c. Do not measure the stalks of flowers or fruits. d. If the leaves directly above or below a node have fallen off and the stem is not measurable, make a note on the datasheet. e. If the tape cannot be found, check on the ground around the shrub to see if the tape has fallen off or the branch has died. Note on the datasheet if the tape is missing or the branch is dead. Do not leave any blank spaces on the datasheet! f. Remove the old tape from the stem. 2.Measure re-taped stem lengths: a. Re-tape the stem with a new piece of tape. Place the tape close to the end of the stem, but with a measurable internode between the tape and the end of the stem. b. Measure the re-taped stem lengths as above and record on the datasheet.

### Leaf Tissue ICPMS
Field collection: (1) Randomly choose 5 creosote plants in each of the 5 study plots for every site (15 sites total). Do not choose shrubs chosen for stem-elongation (growth) measurements. (2) From each plant, randomly select one stem in each of 4 cardinal directions. (3) From each stem, pick 4, fully developed leaf pairs from the green section of the primary stem. We are defining fully developed leaves as those that are just behind the newest leaves (the newest leaves are the 2 undeveloped green ones plus the ones just attached to them). Do not choose leaves that are farther back down the stem or leaves that are brown and/or damaged. (4) Place all leaves from each plot in a coin envelope. (5) Place coin envelopes into a dryer (60 degrees C) upon returning to the laboratory or within 48 h. Lab processing: (1) Rinse all picked leaves with DI water in a clean fine meshed sieve and place in a coin envelope with the site name, plot name, and date processed. (2) Dry all leaves in coin envelopes at 70 degrees C for at least 48 h before grinding. (3) Fill polycarb vial approximately 1/2 full with leaf litter, add one of the polycarb balls and cap vial, place vials in ball mill chamber and mill for 10 minutes. ICPMS: Dried and milled L. tridentata leaf tissue is microwave digested using a CEM MARSXpress. Approximately 0.2500 g of sample was allowed to react with 10 mL of Trace Metal Grade nitric acid (Fisher #A509-P212) for 15 minutes, uncapped, then ran on the CEM using the following method: 1600W at 100% power, ramped up to 180 degrees C over the course of 15 minutes, and held at 180 degrees C for 15 minutes. Samples were diluted at 100X prior to being run by ICP-MS. Samples were analyzed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific X Series 2 quadrapole ICP-MS and Cetac ASX- 520 autosampler. Sample introduction consisted of a conical spray chamber with impact bead and concentric nebulizer with a flow of ~1 ml/min. The spray chamber was cooled to 3 degrees C by a Peltier cooling system. Collision Cell Technology (CCT) mode was utilized to reduce interferences by the argon gas used to generate the plasma by using a mixture of 7% hydrogen and 93% helium for the following elements: Fe, Se, As, and Ca. All other elements were run in normal mode. Internal standards (Sc, Ge, Y, In, and Bi) were used to compensate for sample matrix effects and instrument variability.

### Annuals Biomass
Each spring when there is sufficient rainfall, we estimate aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of herbaceous annual plants in each of the Desert Fertilization Experiment study plots by harvesting the aboveground portion of annual herbs from a 1/2 m x 1/2 m section of established 1 m x 1 m sub-plots. These plots are distinguished from similar 1 m x 1 m sub-plots that are used for community composition. Take care to avoid the community composition sub-plots! Only harvest the sub-plots that are designated for biomass. Protocol overview: In each Desert Fertilization experiment plot, we established 4 biomass sub-plots per plot, two in each of two patch types, between shrubs (IP for inter-plant space) and under the canopies of L. tridentata (P for under plant). Each sub-plot is coded with the patch type (IP or P); the letter B for biomass (to distinguish it from the community composition sub-plots, which are not harvested and do not have a letter B after the patch type code); and the sub-plot number (1 or 2). For example, IPB1 & IPB2 are interplant space sub=plots one and two, and PB1 & PB2 are sub-plots 1 and 2 under L. tridentata shrubs. Remember that the biomass sub-plots are distinguished from the community composition sub-plots with the letter B after the patch type code (example, IPB1 = Biomass sub-plot 1, inter-plant space). Within each 1 m x 1 m biomass sub-plot, teams will clip aboveground annual biomass from one 1/2 m x 1/2 m quadrat in each 1-meter biomass sub-plot. This sub-section is rotated each year so that any given patch of ground is harvested at the most once every four years. Teams will carefully write the plot identifier on paper bags. (Double-check the labels! Labeling mistakes are the most common error in this procedure). Then teams will cut all green and brown herbaceous plant biomass that occurs within the boundaries of the 1/2 m x 1/2 m sub section and place it in the pre-labeled bag. After the harvest is complete, teams will dry the bags and biomass at 60 degrees C for 48 hr then weigh the biomass (subtracting the weight of the bag) on a scale and record.

### Annuals Composition
Overview: In spring 2008 within each site, the CAP LTER randomly chose and permanently marked four 1 m x 1 m sub-plots within each 20 m x 20 m main plot, split between two patch types, under L. tridentata shrubs and inter-plant spaces (hereafter, under L. tridentata, P and Inter-plant space; IP). At peak herbaceous biomass (in approximately March of each year), percent cover of all annual herbaceous species rooted within these four plots (two each under L. tridentata and in interplant spaces i.e. between shrubs) will be estimated. Note that there are also four 1 m x 1 m Biomass sub-plots in each 20 m x 20 m plot – these are different than the community composition plots described here because they are clipped each year while the community composition plots are not. Care should be taken in the field to identify the correct four plots for community composition and avoid the four plots to be harvested for biomass. Steps: 1. On the top of the data sheet (See Table 3 for sample), record the date; names of the sampling crew (i.e. plant identifier, recorder); site (three letter code); plot number (1 to 75); treatment (C1 – no sampling from C2 plots, Nitrogen [N], Phosphorus [P], and Nitrogen+Phosphorus [NP]). Double check the plot numbers and sub-plot numbers! 2. All observers should first calibrate their percent cover estimates on several test plots in the field prior to percent cover measurements. You want to make sure all botanists are seeing the plots similarly. 3. Place the 1 m x 1 m quadrat over the corner rebar at each 1-m2 plot. Working in teams of two (one recorder, one plant identifier), proceed through the steps below. 4. Estimate and record (at the bottom of the data sheet) the relative areal cover of plant matter (e.g. green material) versus bare ground (e.g. brown material) at the soil surface in the plot (e.g. 70% green, 30% brown). If there are soil crusts, measure those as well in a separate category. 5. Identify which annual species are present in the plot and mark a small dot in the corner of the datasheet to easily find later. Use roughly the same amount of effort in each plot to find plant species. As you get better, it will take less time because you are getting more skilled; as you get tired, it will take more time; in simpler systems, it will take less time. There is no a priori way to know when you are using the same amount of effort, but this is usually approximated by time (in minutes: typically 1-3 minutes per species). Each botanist should do some test plots to see how long it takes him/her to find all the species in the plot. Different botanists will take different amounts of time to apply the same effort– this is okay – but the same botanist should use approximately the same amount of time per plot. 6. Next, estimate and record the cover of each species individually to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%…97%, 98%, 99%, 100%). If a species is present in a plot, but does not cover a full 1%, record it as <1%. The sum of all individual species cover can be greater than 100% since some species overlap. 7. Finally, estimate and record the cover of the overstory shrubs within the plot or overhanging the plot. We estimate cover for all annuals rooted in the quadrat, but areal cover of any shrubs rooted in or hanging over the plot. For IP plots, this will be zero most of the time (i.e. unless there is a large shrub nearby that has grown over the plot). For P plots, this will be have two components: (1) the areal projection of the shrub onto the 2-D grid, and (2) the area of the stem base or any other shrub stems. It is expected that the cover of the shrubs overlap the herbaceous species. However if two shrub species overlap in their cover aggregate these into a single larger individual (rare case). 8. Unknown species are recorded with unique identifiers (e.g., Unknown 1, Unknown 2, etc.) along with a visual description of the plant and a picture to be used to help identify the unknown in the lab. When possible, a sample of the unknown species should be collected from outside of the plot in a labeled coin envelope and brought to the herbarium to be identified. Unknown species are usually very small and or undeveloped, and may not be able to be identified to species – this is okay. Err on the side of lumping unknown species into other known species in the same plot. 9. Use caution not to include the percent cover of desiccated/dead plants within the plots from the previous season (these can usually be identified easily as white, old plant material). However, depending on the timing of data collection, some herbaceous plants from the current growing season may have passed peak biomass and already begun to desiccate (dry out or senesce). In this case, estimate the percent cover of these plants as if they were at peak biomass. 10. Before you leave a site, confirm that you have datasheets for all plots and sub-plots, and that there are no duplicates or ambiguous plot labels on your sheet.

### Measuring Bulk and Throughfall NO3 and NH4 Deposition
Ion exchange resin (IER) collectors are used to measure bulk (wet) deposition in interplant open spaces and throughfall (wet and dry) deposition under the dominant shrub. Both bulk and throughfall collectors are deployed with 2 replicates at each site. Collectors are deployed continuously over four 3-month sampling intervals per year – approximately January to March, March to June, June to September, and September to December. Collectors are in the field for an average deployment of 89 days.

Bulk and throughfall IER collectors are constructed with a modified design following Fenn and Poth (2004) and Simkin and colleagues (2004). For each sampling period, IER collectors are made with hydrochloric acid-washed supplies. Each IER collector consisted of a 12-inch PVC pipe filled with 60 mL Monosphere Dowex Resin (Dow Chemical Company). Due to supply issues, Amerlite IRN-150 ion exchange resin replaced Monosphere Dowex in spring 2019. The resin-filled pipe was closed on one end with a PVC cap with 5 – 7 holes drilled for drainage and filled with glass wool to prevent resin loss. On the other end of the resin-filled PVC pipe, nitex screening is used to prevent debris in the resin and a plastic funnel (open area = 314 cm2) is placed onto the top. The funnel is covered with mesh and a bird spikes to prevent debris contamination of the resin.

In the field, bulk collectors are installed 1.5 meters above the ground on rebar in open space areas without canopy cover. Throughfall collectors are placed under L. tridentata, where 2-ft holes were dug and filled partly with aquarium rocks to allow for drainage during storms. All IER collectors (including the funnels and the L. tridentata branches for throughfall collectors) are rinsed with 500 mL di-ionized water before being collected at the end of the sampling period. In addition, field blanks are prepared without a funnel and instead capped on both ends. Field blanks are deployed at one urban (DBG) and two outlying sites (WTM and LDP) with three replicates at each site for both bulk and throughfall field blanks.

After exposed samplers are collected in the field, NH4 and NO3 ions are extracted from each resin sample with 200 mL 2M potassium chloride (KCl) solution. KCl-resin slurries are shaken for one hour and then filtered through Whatman 42 filters pre-leached with KCl. In addition, three KCl extract blanks are prepared. All KCl extracts are analyzed on the continuous flow injection Lachat QuikChem 8000 (Lachat Instruments) for NH4 and NO3.

## Descriptions of Data Sets and Variables
### Annuals_Biomass
Biomass (g) of annual plants harvested from subplots within Desert Fertilization study plots. One-meter subplots include locations around a Larrea tridentata plant and locations in the interplant space between shrubs. Material is harvested from 0.25 square meter quadrants within each subplot. All harvests occur during the spring.
\begin{itemize}
  \item site\_code - site name abbreviation
  \item plot\_id - plot id number
  \item treatment\_code - treatment name abbreviation
